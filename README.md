The task is to build an API server with documentation and a backing relational database that will allow a front-end client to navigate through that sea of data quickly and intuitively. In addition, the front-end team will build the front-end client based on the documentation.

The operations the frontend team would need you to support are:

1. List all pharmacies open at a specific time and on a day of the week if requested.
2. List all masks sold by a given pharmacy, sorted by mask name or price.
3. List all pharmacies with more or less than x mask products within a price range.
4. The top x users by total transaction amount of masks within a date range.
5. The total amount of masks and dollar value of transactions within a date range.
6. Search for pharmacies or masks by name, ranked by relevance to the search term.
7. Process a user purchases a mask from a pharmacy, and handle all relevant data changes in an atomic transaction.
